# 2-Factor-Authentication-Project
This project demonstrates a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system built using Node.js and the Speakeasy package. The system allows users to enable 2FA for their accounts, providing an additional layer of security.

## Introduction
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances the security of user accounts by requiring two forms of verification: something the user knows (password) and something the user has (2FA token). This project uses the Speakeasy package to generate and verify time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
